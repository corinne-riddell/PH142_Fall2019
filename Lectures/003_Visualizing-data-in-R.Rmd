### Announcements

* It is okay if you do not see your Lab 1 or Assignment 1 as "submitted" on Gradescope. It will show up soon (we have to push them from the intermediary product to Gradescope).
* Let the GSIs know if you are experiencing technical issues with the datahub. Either tell them during lab/OHs or email the GSI account.
* Please use the pinned threads on the bCourses discussion forum to ask questions. 
* Lab attendance/completion policy

### Learning objectives for today

1. To finish up the lecture from Friday on `dplyr`
    * `group_by()` and `summarize()`
2. To put to use the `dplyr` commands from last lecture
3. To make beautiful plots using the `ggplot2` package

### Life expectancy in the United States by race and gender, 1969-2013 

These data are partial results from a study that I did on the difference in life 
expectancy between non-Hispanic Black and White men and women in the United 
States over time. 

A subset of the results have been stored in the Data/ folder as a comma separated value (CSV) file.

Do you remember which function to use to import CSV data into R?

### `readr`'s `read_csv()` to import these data

```{r import-csv-data}
library(readr)
le_data <- read_csv("../Data/Life-expectancy-by-state-long.csv")
```

### Four functions to get to know your dataset

Function 1
```{r first-lines}
head(le_data)
```

### Four functions to get to know your dataset

Function 2
```{r dimensions}
dim(le_data)
```

### Four functions to get to know your dataset

Function 3
```{r names}
names(le_data)
```

### Four functions to get to know your dataset

Function 4
```{r structure}
str(le_data)
```

### A new useful function: View()

```{r, eval=F}
View(le_data)
```

`View()` opens the data viewer pane in RStudio. It does not print anything in the
data console.

### Life expectancy for White men in California

Make a scatter plot of the life expectancy for White men in California
over time.

Since the dataset contains 39 states across two genders and two races, first use
a function to subset the data to contain only White men in California.

Which function from last lecture do we need?

* `mutate()`, `select()`, `filter()`, `rename()`, or `arrange()`?

### `dplyr`'s `filter()` to select a subset of rows

```{r wh-cali-dataset}
library(dplyr)
wm_cali <- le_data %>% filter(state == "California", 
                              sex == "Male", 
                              race == "white")

#this is equivalent:
wm_cali <- le_data %>% filter(state == "California" & sex == "Male" & race == "white")
```

### First step to building a `ggplot()`: set up the canvas

- The second line of code below specifies the `data` set and what goes on the `x` and `y` axes

```{r ggplot-canvas, out.width = "80%", fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = wm_cali, aes(x = year, y = LE))
```

### Second step to building a `ggplot()`: tell `ggplot` how to plot the data

```{r ggplot-geom_point, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = wm_cali, aes(x = year, y = LE)) + geom_point()
```

- `geom_point()` tells ggplot to use points to plot these data

### `labs()` to add a title, a caption, and modify x and y axes titles

```{r ggplot-change-titles, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = wm_cali, aes(x = year, y = LE)) + geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Life expectancy in white men in California, 1969-2013",
       y = "Life expectancy", 
       x = "Year", 
       caption = "Data from Riddell et al. (2018)")
```

### `col` controls the color of geom_point()

```{r ggplot-change-col, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = wm_cali, aes(x = year, y = LE)) + geom_point(col = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Life expectancy in white men in California, 1969-2013",
       y = "Life expectancy", 
       x = "Year", 
       caption = "Data from Riddell et al. (2018)")
```

### `size` controls the size of geom_point()

```{r ggplot-change-col-size, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = wm_cali, aes(x = year, y = LE)) + geom_point(col = "blue", size = 4) +
  labs(title = "Life expectancy in white men in California, 1969-2013",
       y = "Life expectancy", 
       x = "Year", 
       caption = "Data from Riddell et al. (2018)")
```

### Line plot rather than scatter plot

What if we wanted to make these data into a line plot instead. What part of the 
code should change?

```{r ggplot-previous-code, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = wm_cali, aes(x = year, y = LE)) + 
  geom_point(col = "blue", size = 4) +
  labs(title = "Life expectancy in white men in California, 1969-2013",
       y = "Life expectancy", 
       x = "Year", 
       caption = "Data from Riddell et al. (2018)")
```

### `geom_line()` to make a line plot

```{r ggplot-geom_line, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = wm_cali, aes(x = year, y = LE)) + geom_line(col = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Life expectancy in white males in California, 1969-2013",
       y = "Life expectancy", 
       x = "Year", 
       caption = "Data from Riddell et al. (2018)")
```

### Life expectancy for White and Black men in California

What do we need to change to make a separate line for both Black and White men?

### First, update the `filter()`

```{r create-new-dataset}
wbm_cali <- le_data %>% filter(state == "California",
                               sex == "Male")
```

### Look at the previous code and output first

```{r ggplot-geom_line-dup, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = wm_cali, aes(x = year, y = LE)) + geom_line(col = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Life expectancy in white men in California, 1969-2013",
       y = "Life expectancy", 
       x = "Year", 
       caption = "Data from Riddell et al. (2018)")
```

### And change it to **link** color to race

```{r ggplot-geom_line-aes, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = wbm_cali, aes(x = year, y = LE)) + geom_line(aes(col = race)) +
  labs(title = "Life expectancy in black and white men in California, 1969-2013",
       y = "Life expectancy", 
       x = "Year", 
       caption = "Data from Riddell et al. (2018)")
```

### Always use the aes() function to link a plot feature to a variable in your data frame

The operative word is *link*. Whenever you want to link something about how 
the plot looks to a variable in the data frame, you need to *link* these items
inside the `aes()` function:

```{r ggplot-link-using-aes, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = wbm_cali, aes(x = year, y = LE)) + geom_line(aes(col = race)) +
  labs(title = "Life expectancy in Black and White men in California, 1969-2013",
       y = "Life expectancy", 
       x = "Year", 
       caption = "Data from Riddell et al. (2018)")
```

### The `aes()` function

* What else was added to the plot when you used the `aes()` function?

### The `aes()` function

* What else was added to the plot when you used the `aes()` function?
    * A legend was added showing the link between the line color and the data 
    frame's race variable

### What if we also wanted to look at women?

### What if we also wanted to look at women?

```{r cali-dataset, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
cali_data <- le_data %>% filter(state == "California")
```

### What is wrong with this plot?

```{r ggplot-whoopsies, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = cali_data, aes(x = year, y = LE)) + geom_line(aes(col = race)) +
  labs(title = "Life expectancy in California, 1969-2013",
       y = "Life expectancy", 
       x = "Year", 
       caption = "Data from Riddell et al. (2018)")
```

### Use `lty()` to **link** line type to sex

```{r ggplot-california, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = cali_data, aes(x = year, y = LE)) + geom_line(aes(col = race, lty = sex)) +
  labs(title = "Life expectancy in California, 1969-2013",
       y = "Life expectancy", 
       x = "Year", 
       caption = "Data from Riddell et al. (2018)")
```

### Use `facet_wrap()` to make separate plots for a specified variable

```{r ggplot-california-facet, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = cali_data, aes(x = year, y = LE)) + 
  geom_line(aes(col = race, lty = sex)) +
  labs(title = "Life expectancy in California, 1969-2013",
       y = "Life expectancy", 
       x = "Year", 
       caption = "Data from Riddell et al. (2018)") +
  facet_wrap(~ sex)
```

### Compare two states

How do we update the `filter` to include data from California and New York?

### Compare two states

```{r two-states, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
updated_data <- le_data %>% filter(state %in% c("California", "New York"))
```

### Let's write the code together

```{r, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
#to fill in during class
```

### Let's write the code together

```{r ggplot-facet_wrap, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = updated_data, aes(x = year, y = LE)) + 
  geom_line(aes(col = race, lty = sex)) +
  labs(title = "Life expectancy in California and New York, 1969-2013",
       y = "Life expectancy", 
       x = "Year", 
       caption = "Data from Riddell et al. (2018)") +
  facet_grid(state ~ sex)
```

### Participation Question!

### So far

- `geom_point()` to make scatter plots
- `geom_line()` to make line plots
- `col = "blue"`, `size = 2`, `lty = 2`, to change color, size and line type of the `geom`
- `aes(col = race)` to *link* color to race
- `aes(lty = sex)` to *link* line type to sex
- `facet_wrap(~ var1)` to make separate plots for different levels of one variable
- `facet_grid(var1 ~ var2)` to make separate plots for combinations of levels of two variables

### What if we wanted to make a histogram...

...of life expectancy of white males in 2013?

Before you code, try and visualize what the histogram will show

- What is on the x axis? What is on the y axis? 

### Update the `filter`

```{r filter-2013-men-white}
wm_data <- le_data %>% filter(year == 2013, sex == "Male", race == "white")
```

### `geom_histogram()` to make histograms

```{r ggplot_geom_histogram, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(dat = wm_data, aes(x = LE)) + geom_histogram()
```

### Use `fill` to change the *fill* of the histogram and `binwidth` to specify the bin's width 

```{r ggplot_geom_histogram-bin-width, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
wm_data <- le_data %>% filter(year == 2013, sex == "Male", race == "white")

ggplot(dat = wm_data, aes(x = LE)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, col = "white", fill = "forest green") 
```

### Apply some of our new skills

```{r ggplot_geom_histogram-more, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
data_2013 <- le_data %>% filter(year == 2013)

ggplot(dat = data_2013, aes(x = LE)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, col = "white", aes(fill = sex)) + 
  facet_grid(race ~ sex)
```

### Recap: What functions did we learn?

1. `ggplot()`
    - `geom_scatter()`
    - `geom_line()`
    - `geom_histogram()`
    - `aes()` to link aesthetics to variables in our data frame
    - `facet_wrap(~ var1)`, `facet_grid(var1 ~ var2)`
    - `labs(title = "Main", y = "y axis", x = "x axis", caption = "below plot")`

### Recap: What arguments were useful?

2. `ggplot()`
    - `col`
    - `size`
    - `lty`
    
### A common `dplyr` mistake to avoid!

With dplyr, the pipe operator goes at the end of the line, not the beginning:

Right way:

```{r}
data_2013 <- le_data %>% 
  filter(year == 2013)

#or

data_2013 <- le_data %>% filter(year == 2013)
```

Wrong way:

```{r, eval=F}
data_2013 <- le_data 
%>% filter(year == 2013)
```

### A common `ggplot` mistake to avoid!

With ggplot2, the "+"" operator goes at the end of the line, not the beginning:

Right way: 

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(dat = data_2013, aes(x = LE)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, col = "white", aes(fill = sex)) + 
  facet_grid(race ~ sex)
```

Wrong way: 

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(dat = data_2013, aes(x = LE))  
  + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, col = "white", aes(fill = sex)) 
  + facet_grid(race ~ sex)
```

### How to get help with code

- Ask questions during discussion, GSI office hours, or on bCourses discussion forum. Use the appropriate thread!
- Develop your online search skills. For example if you have a `ggplot2` question, begin your google search with "r ggplot" and then describe your issues, e.g., "r ggplot how do I make separate lines by a second variable". 
- The most common links that will appear are:
    - https://stackoverflow.com: Crowd-sourced answers that have been upvoted. The top answer is often the best one.
    - https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/: The official ggplot2 webpage is very helpful.
    - https://community.rstudio.com/: The RStudio community page.
    - https://rpubs.com/: Web pages made by R users that often contain helpful tutorials.
