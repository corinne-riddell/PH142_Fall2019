## Motivation

Suppose you received the following graphic illustrating cholesterol measurements following two alternate diets. What do you think about these data? 

```{r make-dataset, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
# Eleven study participants were randomized to each diet, and you're tasked with 
# figuring out whether there is a difference between the diet's average cholesterol levels.

library(tidyverse)
library(RColorBrewer)

set.seed(123)
trt_a <- c(155, 180, 190, 192, 203, 201, 207, 208, 217, 228, 237)

# Model parameters: You can play around with these to see how they affect your analysis.
signal <- 7 # note: this is the true underlying mean difference we will estimate
noise <- 4  # note: 4/sqrt(n) is the true SE of the mean = 1.21, where n = length(trt_a) = 11

trt_b <- trt_a + rnorm(length(trt_a), signal, noise)

chol_dat <- data.frame("A" = trt_a, "B" = trt_b, "id" = 1:length(trt_a))

chol_dat_long <- chol_dat %>% gather(A, B, key = "diet", value = "cholesterol")
```

```{r, out.width="80%", echo=F, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(chol_dat_long, aes(diet, cholesterol)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.03, pch = 21, size = 5, fill = "#2ca25f", alpha = 0.8) + 
  labs(y = "Cholesterol", x = "Diet") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

## Motivation

```{r, out.width="80%", echo=F, fig.align='center'}
means <- chol_dat_long %>% 
  group_by(diet) %>% 
  summarise(mean = round(mean(cholesterol), 1),
            median = round(median(cholesterol), 1))

ggplot(chol_dat_long, aes(diet, cholesterol)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill = "transparent") +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.03, pch = 21, size = 5, fill = "#2ca25f", alpha = 0.8) + 
  labs(y = "Cholesterol", x = "Diet") +
  geom_text(data = means, aes(x = diet, y = 260, label = paste0("Mean: ", mean)), size = 5) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

- What do you notice about the variability between participants under each diet?
- What is the mean difference? 

```{r, echo=F, eval=F}
#There is a lot of between subject variability. This variation has nothing to do with the treatments.
#The mean difference is 7.8 units.
```

## Motivation {.smaller .build}

An independent t-test reveals no evidence against the null hypothesis of no difference between the diets:

```{r, out.width="80%", echo=F, fig.align='center'}
indep_t <- t.test(x = chol_dat %>% pull(B), 
                       y = chol_dat %>% pull(A), mu = 0, 
                       alt = "two.sided", paired = F, 
                       conf.level = 0.95, var.equal = T)

indep_t
```


***

...Oh my! I forgot to tell you that there were only 11 individuals in the study, and each of them tried out both diets. Let me update my visualization to reflect this a little bit better...

## Motivation

Now, what do you notice about the paired data?

```{r, out.width="80%", echo=F, fig.align='center'}
chol_dat_long <- chol_dat_long %>% mutate(diet_n = ifelse(diet == "A", 1, 2))
means <- means %>% mutate(diet_n = ifelse(diet == "A", 1, 2))

ggplot(chol_dat_long, aes(diet_n, cholesterol)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = id), lty = 3, lwd = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(fill = as.factor(id)), pch = 21, size = 5, alpha = 0.8) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral") +
  labs(y = "Cholesterol", x = "Diet") +
  geom_text(data = means, aes(x = diet_n, y = 260, label = paste0("Mean: ", mean)), size = 5) +
  theme_minimal() +
  guides(fill = guide_legend("ID")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, 2), labels = c("A", "B"), limits = c(0.5, 2.5)) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
  theme(panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank())
```

```{r, echo=F, eval=F}
# There is a consistent increase in cholesterol under Diet B. 
# We also know that the mean of the individual differences is equal to the difference
# of the means --> the average of the individual differences is also 209.4-201.6 = 7.8

# So what is different about the test? It's the standard error. 
```

## The paired t-test

- We use a paired t-test when the data is matched <b class = "greentext">by design</b>
    - two observations on the same participant/patient
    
- A paired t-test is a test of the mean <b class = "greentext">differences</b>. It only uses the variation within
subject. 

- It reduces to a one-sample t-test of the differences. The test statistic is:
$T = \frac{\mu_d - 0}{\sigma_d/\sqrt{n}}$

- The observed value of the test statistic is: 
$t = \frac{\bar{x}_d-0}{s_d/\sqrt{n}}$

- It can be compared to a critical value from the t distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom

## Calculate the test statistic, p-value, and 95% confidence interval {.demphasize}

- First let's have a look at the dataset as is:

```{r peak-data} 
head(chol_dat)
```

## Calculate the test statistic, p-value, and 95% confidence interval {.demphasize}

- We can use functions from the library `dplyr` to calculate the test statistic
- Use `mutate` to calculate each participant's difference:

```{r mutate-diff}
chol_dat <- chol_dat %>% 
  mutate(diff = B - A)

head(chol_dat)
```

## Calculate the test statistic, p-value, and 95% confidence interval

- Then use `summarize` to calculate the mean difference ($\hat{\mu}_d$), its
standard error ($\hat{s}_d/\sqrt{n}$), and the observed t-statistic:

```{r calc-t-stat}
summary_stats <- chol_dat %>% 
  summarize(mean_diff = mean(diff),  # mean difference
            std_err_diff = sd(diff)/sqrt(n()),  # SE of the mean 
            t_stat = mean_diff/std_err_diff)   # test statistic

summary_stats
```

## Calculate the test statistic, p-value, and 95% confidence interval {.tiny}

What is the <b class = "greentext">probability</b> of observing a t-stat $\geq$ `r round(summary_stats$t_stat, 2)` or $\leq$ `r round(-summary_stats$t_stat, 2)` using the `pt` command.

```{r graph-t, out.width="80%", echo=F, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data.frame(x = rt(100000, 10)), aes(x = x)) + 
  stat_function(fun = dt, args = list(df = 10)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-9, 9), 
                     breaks = c(-8, -4, 0, 4, 8), 
                     labels = c(-8, -4, 0, 4, 8))  +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(-summary_stats$t_stat, summary_stats$t_stat), lty = 3) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dt, args = list(df = 10), fill = "blue", xlim = c(-5, -summary_stats$t_stat)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dt, args = list(df = 10), fill = "blue", xlim = c(summary_stats$t_stat, 5)) + 
  labs(x = "t distribution") + 
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) 
```

```{r calc-pval}
pt(q = summary_stats %>% pull(t_stat), lower.tail = F, df = 10) * 2
```

## Calculate the test statistic, p-value, and 95% confidence interval {.demphasized}

- To calculate the 95% confidence interval, we need to know the quantile of the 
t distribution such that 2.5% of the data lies above or below it.

- Ask R: What is the <b class = "greentext">quantile</b> such that 97.5% of the t-distribution is below it on 10 degrees of freedom using the `qt` command.

```{r calc-CI}
q <- qt(p = 0.975, lower.tail = T, df = 10)
q
ucl <- summary_stats %>% pull(mean_diff) + (q * summary_stats %>% pull(std_err_diff))   
lcl <- summary_stats %>% pull(mean_diff) - (q * summary_stats %>% pull(std_err_diff))  
c(lcl, ucl)
```

The confidence interval is (`r lcl`, `r ucl`).

## Calculate the test statistic, p-value, and 95% confidence interval {.demphasized}

- Or, have R do the work for you! Just be sure to specify that `paired = T`.
```{r lazy-way}
paired_t <- t.test(chol_dat %>% pull(B), chol_dat %>% pull(A), 
                   alternative = "two.sided", mu = 0, paired = T)
paired_t
```

## Compare the outputs from the independent and paired tests

```{r compare-ts}
indep_t
```

## Compare the outputs from the independent and paired tests

```{r compare-ts2}
paired_t
```

## Compare the outputs from the independent and paired tests {.demphasized}

- What is the same?
- What is different?
- What is the estimate of the standard error of the mean for each test?

## Compare the outputs from the independent and paired tests {.demphasized}

- What is the same?
- What is different?
- What is the estimate of the standard error of the mean for each test?

```{r calc-se}
SE_indep <- (indep_t$estimate[1] - indep_t$estimate[2]) / indep_t$statistic
SE_paired <- paired_t$estimate / paired_t$statistic

c(unname(SE_indep), unname(SE_paired))
```

## Paired t-test: More juice per squeeze

- The standard error was much lower using the paired test. Why?
- Only variation within a subject was used to calculate the SE of the mean difference
- there was much less variation within a subject than between subjects

## The Statistical Method {.emphasized}

**P**roblem<br>
<b class = "greentext">**Plan**<br></b>
**D**ata<br>
**A**nalysis<br>
**C**onclusion

## Plan, a.k.a. experimental design

- Once the **problem** has been stated, the next step is to determine a **plan** to best answer the question.
One of the tenets of design is to maximize <b class = "greentext">**efficiency**</b>. 
- In our toy example, a paired test greatly maximized the efficiency by removing the noise introduced by between-subject variability.

## When is a paired design the appropriate design?

- When "the treatment alleviates a condition rather than affects a cure." (Hills and Armitrage, 1979)
- The effect of treatment is short-term. After $x$ amount of time, participants return to baseline.
- The $x$ above refers to the <b class = "greentext">**wash-out**</b> period. Before applying the second treatment, participants should have enough time to reach their baseline level. Otherwise there may be a <b class = "greentext">**carry over**</b> effect.

## When is a paired design the appropriate design?

- The time between the alternative treatments isn't so long as to introduce confounding by other factors.
- For example, if you waited a year between applying treatments, other things may have changed in the world
or in a person's life that affects the outcome.
- Thus, there is a balance between waiting too long or not waiting long enough.

## Example: Canned soup, fresh soup, and urinary bisphenol A (BPA)

Reference: Carwile JL, Ye X, Zhou X, Calafat AM, Michels KB. **Canned soup consumption and urinary bisphenol A: a randomized crossover trial**. *JAMA*. 2011. 306(20):2218-20.

- One group randomized to consuming canned soup for five days at lunch
- Second group randomized to consuming fresh soup
- After two day washout, treatment assignment were reversed
- On the 4th and 5th day of each treatment, urine samples were collected and pooled
for each subject to measure BPA

## Example: Canned soup, fresh soup, and urinary bisphenol A (BPA)

- Paired t-test used to measure the difference
- After canned soup consumption, urinary BPA concentrations were 22.5 ug/L higher
(95% CI: 19.6, 25.5) than those measured after fresh soup consumption (p < .001)

## Example: Canned soup, fresh soup, and urinary bisphenol A (BPA)

- Treatment sequence did not appear to affect the results 

```{r create-figure, echo=F, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4}
#fake data to approximate their Figure
mean_bpa <- c(1.1, 1.0, 22.3, 19.4)
ucl_bpa <- c(1.2, 1.1, 27.4, 24.3)
lcl_bpa <- c(0.9, 0.9, 17.3, 14.5)
trt <- c(rep("Fresh soup", 2), rep("Canned soup", 2))
first_trt <- rep(c("Fresh soup", "Canned soup"), 2)

soup_dat <- data.frame("mean" = mean_bpa, "ucl" = ucl_bpa, "lcl"= lcl_bpa,
                       "trt" = trt, "First Treatment" = first_trt)

ggplot(soup_dat, aes(x = trt, y = mean)) + 
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lcl, ymax = ucl), width = 0.1, size = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~ First.Treatment, labeller = "label_both") +
  ylab("Urinary bisphenol A (ug/L)") +
  xlab("") + theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 15),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 15), 
        strip.text = element_text(size = 15))
```

```{r, echo=F, eval=F}

# 1. Identify the two treatments and their duration.
# 2. How long is the washout period?
# 3. What would you need to consider to know if this washout period is long enough?
# 4. The authors state, "In the absence of a period effect, we used a paired t-test...". 
# What do you think they mean by a period effect?
# 5. What assumption does the figure investigate?

```

## Statistical assumptions of the paired t-test

- The sample is randomly chosen. How was the sample selected?
- The distribution of differences is normal. How could you examine this assumption?

## Observational analogues

- Recall from our earlier example the primary benefit of the paired t-test
- Total removal of between-subject variability
- Observational settings at high risk of confounding due to differences between subjects
can also benefit from this design
- Here, we're less interested in testing, and more interested in effect estimation

## Example: Vaccination during infancy and healthcare utilization

- While there are many disproven concerns about vaccination, one potentially valid concern is that 
vaccination may trigger an immune response and lead to inflammation and associated hospital visits (Wilson et al, 2011)

- For non-live vaccines, any adverse inflammation event would occur within 3 days of vaccination

- How might you study the effect of vaccination on healthcare utilization?

```{r, echo=F}
#You can compared children exposed to vaccinate vs. children unexposed 
#But the biggest risk is that these children will differ (risk for bias from 
#confounding is high)
#variables related to avoidance of vaccination and risk of outcome:
#eg parental edu, ethnicity, maternal age, smoking, birth weight, etc
```

## Example: Vaccination during infancy and healthcare utilization

- To fully remove confounding from differences between children, you could conduct a paired design
in an observational setting
- You can compare a period of time after vaccination to a control period of time *for each child*

## Example: Vaccination during infancy and healthcare utilization

- When should the control period be?
- How long should the washout period be?

## Example: Vaccination during infancy and healthcare utilization

Reference: Wilson K, Hawken S, et al. *Vaccine*. 2011;29(21):3746-52.

```{r vaccine-pic, echo=F}
img <- png::readPNG("../Images/vaccine-case-series.png")
grid::grid.raster(img)
```

## Example: Vaccination during infancy and healthcare utilization

- "333,244 children received a vaccination at 62 days of age ±30
days, 86% of which were within a ±10 days window. Of these, 1388
experienced one of the combined end-points during the immediate
3 days post vaccination, compared to 4893 in the 9-day control
period for our primary analysis. The relative incidence of an event
was 0.85 (0.80–0.90)."

## Example: Vaccination during infancy and healthcare utilization {.build}

- 1388 events in 3 days after vaccination among 333,244 children
    - This implies 462.7 events per day for these children
- 4893 events in 9 days after vaccination among 333,244 children
    - This implies 543.7 events per day for the same number of children
- The relative difference is: 462.7/543.7 = 0.85, as stated in the paper

## Summary

1. Use a paired t-test in an experimental setting where the data is paired by design.
    - Pairing can greatly improve efficiency of the estimator 
2. Incorporate pairing/clustering into observational analyses when the data is paired/cluster by design or in nature.
    - Pairing eliminates confounding from factors that differ between subjects
