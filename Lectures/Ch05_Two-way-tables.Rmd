### Learning objectives for today

* How to visualize and quantify relationships between two categorical variables
* Two-way tables: marginal vs. conditional distributions
* Bar graphs: side by side vs. stacked
* Simpson's paradox

### Two-way tables

- Two-way stands for 2X2, as in a table with two columns and two rows
- Used to examine the relationship between 2 categorical variables, originally those with two levels
- Foundational to epidemiology, because of the types of variables we are often interested in

### Classic 2X2 table format

|Exposure group | Disease      | No disease     | Row total |
|--------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
|Exposed        |A             | B              | A+B       |
|Not Exposed    |C             | D              | C+D       |
|Column total   | A+C          | B+D            | A+B+C+D   |

### Example: Lung cancer and smoking

|Group         | Lung Cancer | No Lung Cancer | Row total |
|-------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
|Smoker        | 12           | 238            | 250       |
|Non-smoker    | 7            | 743            | 750       |
|Column total  | 19           | 981            | 1000      |

### Marginal distribution

- The **marginal distribution** of a variable is the one that is **in the margin** 
of the table (i.e., the Row total or the Column total are the two margins of a 
two-way table). 
- The marginal distribution is the distribution for a single categorical variable
- We learned in Ch.1 how to plot marginal distributions of categorical variables using `geom_bar()`

### Marginal distribution

|Group         | Lung Cancer | No Lung Cancer | Row total |
|-------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
|Smoker        | 12           | 238            | 250       |
|Non-smoker    | 7            | 743            | 750       |
|Column total  | 19           | 981            | 1000      |

- Overall, what % of the population has lung cancer?
    - Answer:
- Overall, what % of the population are smokers?
    - Answer: 
    
### Marginal distribution

|Group         | Lung Cancer | No Lung Cancer | Row total |
|-------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
|Smoker        | 12           | 238            | 250       |
|Non-smoker    | 7            | 743            | 750       |
|Column total  | 19           | 981            | 1000      |

- Overall, what % of the population has lung cancer?
    - Answer: 19/1000 = 1.9%
- Overall, what % of the population are smokers?
    - Answer: 250/1000 25% smoking 
- The **marginal** distribution of lung cancer is 1.9% lung cancer, 98.1% no lung cancer.

### Conditional distribution

|Group        | Lung Cancer | No Lung Cancer | Row total |
|-------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
|Smoker       | 12           | 238            | 250       |
|Non-smoker   | 7            | 743            | 750       |
|Column total | 19           | 981            | 1000      |

- The **conditional distribution** is the distribution of one variable **within** or
**conditional on** the level of a second variable
- What is the conditional distribution of lung cancer **given** smoking? 
    - Answer:
- What is the conditional distribution of lung cancer **given** non-smoking?
    - Answer:

### Conditional distribution

|Group         | Lung Cancer | No Lung Cancer | Row total |
|-------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
|Smoker       | 12           | 238            | 250       |
|Non-smoker   | 7            | 743            | 750       |
|Column total | 19           | 981            | 1000      |

- The **conditional distribution** is the distribution of one variable **within** or
**conditional on** the level of a second variable
- What is the conditional distribution of lung cancer **given** smoking? 
    - Answer: 12/250 = 4.8% lung cancer and 238/250 = 95.2% no lung cancer
- What is the conditional distribution of lung cancer **given** non-smoking?
    - Answer: 7/750 = 0.9% lung cancer and 743/750 = 99.1% no lung cancer
      
## Visualization of conditional distributions

### Marginal and conditional distributions in R    

- We learned in Ch.1 how to plot marginal distributions of categorical variables using `geom_bar()`
- Can we generalize the use of `geom_bar()` to plot multiple conditional
distributions? I.e., can we show the conditional distribution of lung cancer for 
smokers and non-smokers on the same plot?

First, we encode the data to read into R:

```{r encode-table-into-dataframe}
# students, you don't need to know how to do this
two_way <- tribble(~ smoking,      ~ lung_cancer,    ~ percent, ~number,
                     "smoker",       "lung cancer",    4.8,      12,
                     "smoker",       "no lung cancer", 95.2,     238,
                     "non-smoker",   "lung cancer",    0.9,      7, 
                     "non-smoker",   "no lung cancer", 99.1,     743
                   )
```

### Visualization of conditional distributions

>If there is an explanatory-response relationship, compare the conditional distribution of the response variable for the separate values of the explanatory variable.

### Dodged bar chart for the visualization of conditional distributions

```{r visualize-conditional-bar-chart-dodged, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(two_way, aes(x = smoking, y = percent)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = lung_cancer), stat = "identity", position = "dodge")  +
  labs(title = "Dodged bar chart") + theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Syntax: Dodged bar chart for the visualization of conditional distributions

```{r visualize-conditional-bar-chart-dodged-syntax, eval=F}
#students, remove eval=F if you copy this code chunk (or else the code won't compile)
ggplot(data, aes(x = exposure_variable, y = percent)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = outcome_variable), stat = "identity", position = "dodge")  +
  labs(title = "Dodged bar chart") + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Stacked bar chart for the visualization of conditional distributions

```{r visualize-conditional-bar-chart-stacked, out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(two_way, aes(x = smoking, y = percent)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = lung_cancer), stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  labs(title = "Stacked bar chart") + theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Syntax: Stacked bar chart for the visualization of conditional distributions

```{r visualize-conditional-bar-chart-stacked-syntax, eval=F}
#students, remove eval=F if you copy this code chunk (or else the code won't compile)
ggplot(data, aes(x = exposure_variable, y = percent)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = outcome_variable), stat = "identity", position = "stack")  +
  labs(title = "Stacked bar chart") + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Visualization of conditional distributions: three levels of response variable

- Stacked and dodged plots are less informative when there are only two levels 
of both variables. 
- This is because once you know the percent of lung cancer among smokers, you 
also know the percent of non-lung cancer among smokers. This makes some of the 
information redundant.
- The plots are more informative if there are 3 or more levels for at least one
of the variables

### Visualization of conditional distributions: three levels of response variable

- Example 2: Shoe support by gender (Data from Baldi & Moore page 124 of Ed.4):

|Group               | Men  | Women | **Row total** |
|-------------------:|:----:|:-----:|:-------------:|
|Good support        | 94   | 137   | 231           |
|Average support     | 1348 | 581   | 1929          |
|Poor support        | 30   | 1182  | 1212          |
|**Column total**    | 1472 | 1900  | 3372          |

### Participation Question!

### Visualization of conditional distributions: three levels of response variable

- Example 2: Shoe support by gender (Data from Baldi & Moore page 124 of Ed.4):

|Group               | Men  | Women | **Row total** |
|-------------------:|:----:|:-----:|:-------------:|
|Good support        | 94   | 137   | 231           |
|Average support     | 1348 | 581   | 1929          |
|Poor support        | 30   | 1182  | 1212          |
|**Column total**    | 1472 | 1900  | 3372          |

- The question: How does the distribution of support of shoes worn vary between
men and women?

### Visualization of conditional distributions: three levels of response variable

```{r encode-shoe-data}
# students, you don't need to know how to do this
shoe_data <- tribble(~ shoe_support, ~ gender, ~ percent,
                       "good",         "men",    94/1472, 
                       "average",      "men",    1348/1472,
                       "poor",         "men",    30/1472,
                       "good",         "women",  137/1900,
                       "average",      "women",  581/1900,
                       "poor",         "women",  1182/1900)
shoe_data
```

### Stacked visualization when there are three levels of response

```{r shoe-stacked, out.width = "60%"}
ggplot(shoe_data, aes(x = gender, y = percent)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = shoe_support), position = "stack") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Dodged visualization when there are three levels of response

```{r shoe-dodged, out.width = "60%"}
ggplot(shoe_data, aes(x = gender, y = percent)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = shoe_support), position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Dodged visualization when there are three levels of response

Question: what is misleading about the fill legend?

```{r shoe-dodged-2, out.width = "60%"}
ggplot(shoe_data, aes(x = gender, y = percent)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = shoe_support), position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Dodged visualization when there are three levels of response

Question: what is misleading about the fill legend?

Answer: It is in alphabetic order, which is different from the natural order of this variable. 

Question 2: How can we change the order in the legend?

```{r shoe-dodged-3, out.width = "60%"}
ggplot(shoe_data, aes(x = gender, y = percent)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = shoe_support), position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Dodged visualization when there are three levels of response

Question 2: How can we change the order in the legend?

Answer 2: Recall from last class we learned how to reorder factor variables that affect
the look of the plot:

```{r shoe-dodge-reorder, out.width="60%"}
shoe_data <- shoe_data %>% 
  mutate(shoe_support = fct_relevel(shoe_support, "good", "average", "poor"))

ggplot(shoe_data, aes(x = gender, y = percent)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = shoe_support), position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Dodged visualization when there are three levels of response

You might also want to specify the colors used to communicate that poor shoe support is painful!

```{r shoe-dodge-recol, out.width="60%"}
ggplot(shoe_data, aes(x = gender, y = percent)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = shoe_support), position = "dodge", col = "black") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#1a9641", "#fdae61", "#d7191c"))
```

### Visualization of conditional distributions: three levels of response variable

In general, dodged plots are preferred over stacked plots. Why do you think that is?

## Simpson's Paradox

### Simpson's Paradox: Example from Baldi and Moore

- Let's load these data that examines mortality rates by community and age group across two communities

```{r copy-data-from-book}
#this is the data from page 131 of edition 4 of baldi and moore
simp_data <- tribble(~ age_grp, ~ community, ~ deaths, ~ pop,
                       "0-34",    "A",         20,       1000, 
                       "35-64",   "A",         120,      3000,
                       "65+",     "A",         360,      6000,
                       "all",     "A",         500,      10000,
                       "0-34",    "B",         180,      6000,
                       "35-64",   "B",         150,      3000,
                       "65+",     "B",         70,       1000,
                       "all",     "B",         400,      10000)

simp_data <- simp_data %>% 
  mutate(death_per_1000 = (deaths/pop) * 1000)

simp_data_no_all <- simp_data %>% filter(age_grp != "all")
```

### Simpson's Paradox: Example from Baldi and Moore

```{r}
simp_data
```

### Simpson's Paradox Example: Plot only the conditional data

- Plot the mortality rates according to age group and community and link the point size to population size

```{r simpson-para-1, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(simp_data_no_all, aes(x = age_grp, y = death_per_1000)) + 
  geom_point(aes(col = community, size = pop)) + 
  labs(title = "Death rate by age group, community, and population size") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

Observations from this visualization:

1. `r #mortality is higher for older folks`
2. `r #mortality is higher for community B, within each age group`
3. `r #community A has many more older individuals, community B has many more younger individuals`

If someone ask you which community has higher mortality, what would you say?

### Simpson's Paradox Example: Add the marginal data

- Add in the **marginal** data (not conditional on age)
- Notice that the mortality rates for the communities overall show community A
having a higher rate than community B. Why?

```{r simpsons-with-marginal, out.width="50%", fig.align='center', echo=F}
ggplot(simp_data, aes(x = age_grp, y = death_per_1000)) + 
  geom_point(aes(col = community, size = pop)) + 
  labs(title = "Death rate by age group, community, and population size") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Simpson's Paradox

"An association or comparison that holds for all of several groups can **reverse
direction** when the data are combined to form a single group. This reversal is 
called **Simpson's Paradox**"

### Simpson's Paradox

- Here are the same data shown using a bar chart 
- Notice that the mortality rate for each of the blue-shaded bars in community 
B is higher than the correponding bar for community A, but the overall bar 
(shaded in gray) shows a reversal.

```{r bar-chart-simpsons-paradox, out.width="50%", echo=F}
#students, don't need to know the scale_fill_manual() function
ggplot(simp_data, aes(x = community, y = death_per_1000)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = age_grp), position = "dodge", stat = "identity", col = "white") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#74a9cf", "#0570b0", "#034e7b", "grey"))
  # this scale function allows you to manually set your fill colors
  # colours declared with "#123456" are called hex codes and you can find them online!
```

### Simpson's Paradox

- With a bar chart we can't use `aes(size = pop)`, so it is harder to see why the 
paradox is occuring.
- It is because we are taking a weighted average of each age-specific bar with 
weights proportional to the number of people of each age group in each community

```{r bar-chart-simpsons-paradox-2, out.width="50%", echo=F}
#students, don't need to know the scale_fill_manual() function
ggplot(simp_data, aes(x = community, y = death_per_1000)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = age_grp), position = "dodge", stat = "identity", col = "white") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#74a9cf", "#0570b0", "#034e7b", "grey"))
  # this scale function allows you to manually set your fill colors
  # colours declared with "#123456" are called hex codes and you can find them online!
```
