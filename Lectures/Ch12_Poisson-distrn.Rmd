### The Poisson distribution

- So far in chapter 12, we've covered the binomial distribution. 

- Ch. 12 covers another distribution for counts: the Poisson distribution. 

- The main distinction between Binomial and Poisson is that Poisson random 
variables have no upper bound, whereas the upper bound of a binomial random 
variable $X$ was $n$, the size of the sample.

- Most commonly, the Poisson distribution is used to model rare events.

### The Poisson distribution

- A Poisson distribution describes the count $X$ of occurrences of a defined 
event in fixed, finite intervals of time or space when:

1. Occurrences are all independent (that is, knowing that one event has occurred 
does not change the probability that another event may occur), and,
2. The probability of an occurrence is the same over all possible intervals of 
the same size.

### Examples of the Poisson distribution 

Rare, but infectious diseases. For example, the number of deaths $X$ attributed
to typhoid fever over a long period of time, say 1 year, follows a Poisson 
distribution if:

a) The probability of a new death from typhoid fever in any one day is very small.
b) The number of cases reported in any two distinct periods of time are independent
random variables.

### Examples of the Poisson distribution

Rare events occurring on a surface area. The distribution of number of bacterial 
colonies growing on an agar plate. The number of bacterial colonies over the 
entire agar plate follows a Poisson distribution if: 

a) The probability of finding any bacterial colonies in a small area is very small.
b) The events of finding bacterial colonies in any two areas are independent.

### Poisson probabilities

If $X$ has the Poisson distribution with a mean number of occurrences per interval
of $\mu$, the possible values of X are 0, 1, 2, and so on. If $k$ is any one of these 
values, then 

$$P(X=k)={\frac{e^{-\mu} \mu^k}{k!} }$$

* The above formula is the probability distribution function for a Poisson distribution.
* For example, $$P(X=2)={\frac{e^{-\mu} \mu^2}{2!} }$$ will calculate the probability of observing two events for $X \sim Pois(\mu)$

### Mean and SD of a Poisson random variable

- The mean of a Poisson random variable is equal to $\mu$. 
- The variance is also equal to $\mu$, and thus the SD is equal to $\sqrt{\mu}$.
- When the mean is large, so is the SD, and this makes for a flat and wide 
probability distribution. 
- Poisson distributions are most commonly used to describe rare, random events
(or random events examined over small time intervals).
- In R, the function to calculate $P(X=x)$ for a binomial `dpois(x=?, lambda=?)`,
where `lambda` ($\lambda$) is equal to the average $\mu$ (which is the book's notation).

### Example: Mumps

In Iowa, the average monthly number of reported cases of mumps per year is 0.1.
If we assume that cases of mumps are random and independent, the number $X$ of 
monthly mumps cases in Iowa has approximately a Poisson distribution with 
$\mu=0.1$. The probability that in a given month there is no more than 1 mumps 
case is:

$P(X \leq 1) = P(X=0) + P(X=1)$ 

= ${\frac{e^{-0.1} 0.1^0}{0!} } + {\frac{e^{-0.1} 0.1^1}{1!} }$ (note that 0! = 1, by definition, and $x^0$=1, for any value of x.)

= 0.9048 + 0.0905 = 0.9953 

Thus, we expect to only see 0 cases 90.5% of the months, and 1 case 9.05% of the
time. 

### Example: Mumps calculated using R using `ppois()` and `dpois()`

```{r}
ppois(q = 1, lambda = 0.1) # notice that lambda is the parameter

# or, 
dpois(x = 0, lambda = 0.1) + dpois(x = 1, lambda = 0.1)
```

### Example: Mumps, continued

Suppose you saw 4 cases of Mumps in a given month. What are the chances of seeing
4 or more cases in any given month?

```{r}
1 - ppois(q = 3, lambda = 0.1) #careful, we used q = 3 here, why 3 and not 4?
```

Could you have performed this calculation using `dpois()`?

If you saw 4 or more cases in any given month, this is very unlikely under this
model. This suggests a substantial departure from the model, suggesting a 
contagious outbreak (no longer independent)

### Example: Polydactyly

In the US, 1 in every 500 babies is born with an extra finger or toe. These 
events are random and independent. Suppose that the local hospital delivers an
average of 268 babies per month. This means that for each month we expect to see
0.536 babies born with an extra finger or toe at that hospital (how do you calculate 
0.536 here?). Let $X$ be the count of babies born with an extra finger or toe in a
month at that hospital.

a) What values can $X$ take?
b) What distribution might $X$ follow?
c) Give the mean and standard deviation of $X$.

### Example: Polydactyly, continued

To get a sense of what the data might look like, use R to simulate data across
five years (60 months) for this hospital.

```{r}
rpois(n = 12*5, lambda = 0.536)
```

### More random number generation 

Examining a stream of Poisson-distributed random numbers helps us get a sense
of what these data look like. Can you think of a variable that might be Poisson-
distributed according to one of these distributions?

```{r}
rpois(100, lambda = 0.1)
rpois(100, lambda = 0.5)
rpois(100, lambda = 1)
```
