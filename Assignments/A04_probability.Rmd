Helpful hints:

- Every function you need to use was taught during lecture! So you may need to 
revisit the lecture code to help you along by opening the relevant files on data 
hub. Alternatively, you may wish to view the code in the condensed PDFs posted 
on bCourses (under Files > Lectures). Good luck!

- Knit your file early and often to minimize knitting errors! If you copy and 
paste code for the slides, you are bound to get an error that is hard to 
diagnose. Typing out the code is the way to smooth knitting! We recommend 
knitting your file each time after you write a few sentences/add a new code 
chunk, so you can detect the source of knitting errors more easily. This will 
save you and the GSIs from frustration!

- If your code runs off the page of the knitted PDF then you will LOSE POINTS! To
avoid this, have a look at your knitted PDF and ensure all the code fits in the 
file. When it doesn't, go back to your .Rmd file and add spaces (new lines) using
the return or enter key so that the code runs onto the next line.

**[12 points] Question 1: Simulating birth defect data and sampling from an infinitely large population** 

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in every
33 infants is born with a birth defect in the United States each year.

a) [3 points] Define a random variable for "birth defect". Write down the 
probability model for the random variable. Round each percentage to two decimal
places (e.g., 0.43224 would be rounded to 43.22%). Is the sample space discrete
or continuous?

Replace the text with your list of proportions and your explanation.

You might want to use the table template below to write out your probability 
model. If not, then delete it.

| Tables   |      Are     |  Cool |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| yadi     | type stuff   | X     |
| yadi     | more stuff   | Y     |
| yada     | etc          | Z     |

\newpage

b) [2 points] Simulate data that equals 0 if there is no birth defect and equals
1 if there is a birth defect. Simulate this data for 200 births at a local 
hospital. Be sure to use the risk of birth defect from part a). Assign your 
simulated output the name `sim_01`. Hint: See the lab "lab04_probability" to 
remind yourself how to simulate data of this form. Print your simulated births 
to the screen.

Before you run your simulation, we will "set the seed". We all will set the seed
to 100. This means that everyone's simulation will yield the exact same dataset.

```{r set-seed}
set.seed(100) 
# execute this line before you write your simulation code.
# only execute the set.seed() function one time. 
```

```{r simulate-200-births}
#replace this line with your simulation code.
```

Notice that `sim_01` is not a data frame (it is a vector of numbers). The 
following code stores `sim_01` as a data frame and changes its variable name. 
IMPORTANT: Remove `eval=F` from the chunk options and run this code and view 
`sim_01` in the Viewer pane. Otherwise, you will have trouble knitting your file.

```{r conduct-sim, message=F, warning=F, eval=F}
library(dplyr)
sim_01 <- as.data.frame(sim_01) # watch what happens to sim_01 in your environment
names(sim_01) # prints the variable names in the sim_01 data frame
sim_01 <- sim_01 %>% rename(birth_defect = sim_01)
```

\newpage

c) [2 points] Write code to determine the number of birth defects that occurred in your 
simulation, and the corresponding proportion with birth defects. Assign your 
output the name `output_01`. Print `output_01` to the screen. Hint: Use `dplyr` functions
to do this.

```{r num-and-proportion}
#replace this line with your code
```

\newpage

d) [2 marks] Re-run your simulation four more times and assign the output to a unique 
name each time. Print to the screen the number and proportion after each run. 
(Basically, "recycle" the code above four times)

```{r rerun-sims}
#replace this line with your code
```

\newpage

e) [2 marks] List in increasing order the simulated proportions from each of your five
simulations. Did you get close to the true value? Explain why there is variation
in the proportions across the simulations.

Replace the text with your list of proportions and your explanation.

\newpage

f) [1 mark] Suppose that rather than simulating 5 samples of size 200, we simulated 5 samples
of size 1000. In 1-2 sentences, how would you expect the group of proportion 
estimates from part e) to be different? Comment both on the accuracy of these 
values at predicting the true value, and their variance. If you're not sure, you
can re-run your simulation with a larger sample size and see how the results 
change to deduct the difference.

Replace the text with your answer.

**[8 points] Question 2: Probability of HIV and Hepatitis C**

Approximately 1.1 million Americans have HIV and 3.5 million Americans have 
Hepatitis C (HCV). The number of individuals with coinfection (e.g., both HIV 
and HCV) is 300,000. Among individuals with HIV, approximately 25% have 
Hepatitis C. The total US population was approximately 321 million at the time 
of these statistics.

b) [2 points] Without using the number of co-infections provided in the question,
calculate the probability that someone will have both HIV and HCV.

c) [2 points] Are HIV and HCV infections independent? Show work to support your 
answer.

d) [2 points] In general, does P(A|B) equal P(B|A)? Calculate P(HIV | HCV) and
report whether or not it is equal to P(HCV | HIV).

**[9 points] Question 3: Screening for lung cancer**

Background reading: Read pages 258-261 (and optionally 261-264) of Baldi & 
Moore, Edition 4. (For earlier editions, look for the section on diagnostic 
testing in medicine or on screening which covers sensitivity, specificity, 
negative predictive value, and positive predictive value). 

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States.
Researchers examined the idea of testing all Medicare-enrolled heavy smokers for
lung cancer with a computed tomography (CT) scan every year. In this population, 
the lifetime chance of developing lung cancer is high. In any given year, 
approximately 3% of heavy smokers develop lung cancer. The CT scan positively
identifies lung cancer 89% of the time, and it gives a negative result for 93% 
of individuals who do not have lung cancer.

\newpage

a) [3 points] Use probability notation to express the three probabilities cited.
Make sure to define each event using a capital letter. Provide the terminology 
for the 89% and 93% values based on your readings.

Replace this text with your answer.

\newpage

b) [3 points] What percent of CT scans in this target population would be 
positive? Answer this question by making either a probability tree or using 
absolute frequencies. Show your work.

Replace this text with your answer.

If you are making a tree diagram, you may want to upload an image 
of a hand-drawn tree diagram (this is optional) rather than trying to do this in R.
If so, use the following code to upload an image below. When you knit your file,
make sure the image is oriented correctly (right side up) and a reasonable side.
If not, you can edit your original image using your computer's software (e.g., 
preview on a Mac). Be sure to remove the option "eval = F" if using  this code 
or it won't execute the code when you knit the file:

```{r show-image, out.width="80%", eval=F}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("../Images/your-scans-name.jpg")
# Once you replace the above line with your file's name (after uploading the file
# to datahub's Image sub-directory) you can execute the line of code and 
# verify that the tree diagram is printed below the code chunk.
```

\newpage

c) [3 points] What is the probability that a Medicare-enrolled heavy smoker who gets a 
positive scan actually has lung cancer? Write out the probability statement for
this amount and calculate it based on your part (a) work. What term from your 
reading does this value represent?
